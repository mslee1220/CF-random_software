# Examples
We provide some examples how users can run the CF-random with different modes.<br>
First two modes such as fold-switching and alternative conformation are default modes of CF-random and the last one is a blind mode.
## 1. For CF-random with fold-switching mode. <br>
For this example, RfaH would be predicted with two reference structures (i.e., 2oug_C.pdb and 6c6s_D.pdb) and a MSA file.
```
python main.py --fname 2oug_C-search/ --pdb1 2oug_C.pdb --pdb2 6c6s_D.pdb --option FS
```
### Used input files: <br>
* PDB1: 2oug_C.pdb <br>
* PDB2: 6c6s_D.pdb <br>
* MSA: 2oug_C-search/0.a3m (MSA file should be in a folder) <br>
* range_fs_pairs_all.txt (This file is required for reading the fold-switching region in refernece and predicted structures. Users should check the region before running this mode.) <br>

*This takes <30 Minutes to run on an A100 GPU (generates 300 structures total).* <br>

### Generated output files: <br>
_Predicted files from deep and random MSAs are deposited in 'successed_prediction' directory, and ensembles were in 'additional_sampling' folder._ <br>
_If CF-random fails to find the selected random MSA, all generated files will be in 'failed_prediction' directory._ <br>
* TM-score plot of whole structure: TMscore_fs-region_full-MSA_2oug_C.png <br>
* TM-score plot of fold-switching region: TMscore_full-MSA_2oug_C.png <br>
* TM-score plot of fold-switching region with label of prediction rank: TMscore_fs-region_full-MSA_2oug_C_label.png <br> 
* TM-scores and plDDT scores of predictions with deep MSA: TMs_plDDT_full_all_2oug_C.csv <br>
* TM-scores and plDDT scores of predictions with random MSAs: TMs_plDDT_rand_all_2oug_C.csv <br>
* TM-scores and and plDDT scores of predictions with ensembles: TMs_plDDT_addi_all_2oug_C.csv
  - TM-scores of whole structure and fold-switching regions were saved in TMs_plDDT~ file with ensembles. <br>
* Selection of random MSA: selected_MSA-size_2oug_C.csv (When CF-random finds the MSA depth)
  - MSA depth information (e.g. # = max-seq:max-seq-extra) (0 = 1:2, 1 = 2:4, 2 = 4:8, 3 = 8:16, 4 = 16:32, 5 = 32:64, 6 = 64:128) <br>


## 2. For CF-random with alternative conformation mode. <br>
For this mode, Beta-phosphoglucomutase would be predicted with two reference structures (i.e., 2wfa.pdb and 2wf5.pdb) and an MSA file. <br>
```
python main.py --fname P71447-search --pdb1 2wfa_A.pdb --pdb2 2wf5_A.pdb --option AC --nMSA 15
```
### Used input files: <br>
* PDB1: 2wfa_A.pdb <br>
* PDB2: 2wf5_A.pdb <br>
* MSA: 5olw_A-search/0.a3m (MSA file should be in a folder) <br>

*This takes <90 Minutes to run on an A100 GPU (generates 800 structures total; protein is large: ~250 residues).* <br>

### Generated output files: <br>
_Predicted files from deep and random MSAs are deposited in 'successed_prediction' directory, and ensembles were in 'additional_sampling' folder._ <br>
_If CF-random fails to find the selected random MSA, all generated files will be in 'failed_prediction' directory._ <br>
* TM-score plot of whole structure: TMscore_full-MSA_5olw_A.png <br>
* TM-scores and plDDT scores of predictions with deep MSA: TMs_plDDT_full_all_5olw_A.csv <br>
* TM-scores and plDDT scores of predictions with random MSAs: TMs_plDDT_rand_all_5olw_A.csv <br>
* TM-scores and and plDDT scores of predictions with ensembles: TMs_plDDT_addi_all_5olw_A.csv
  - TM-scores of whole structure were saved in TMs_plDDT~ file with ensembles. <br>
* Selection of random MSA: selected_MSA-size_3drh_A.csv (When CF-random finds the MSA depth)
  - MSA depth information (e.g. # = max-seq:max-seq-extra) (0 = 1:2, 1 = 2:4, 2 = 4:8, 3 = 8:16, 4 = 16:32, 5 = 32:64, 6 = 64:128) <br>

## 3. For CF-random with blind mode covering both fold-switching and alternative conformation. <br>
```
python main.py --pname Mad2_test --fname 2vfx_L-search/ --option blind
```

*Before running this code, make a symbolic link to the foldseek pdb libraries in the directory where you run the command above.*

### Used input files: <br>
MSA: 2vfx_L-search/0.a3m (MSA file should be in a folder) <br>


### Generated output files: <br>
_Predicted files from deep and random MSAs are deposited in 'blind_prediction' directory._ <br>
_If user uses the option '--pname', the name of output files would be entered '--pname'._<br>
* List of prediction files, foldseek searched pdb name, TM-score, and foldseek score: Mad2_test.csv
* Best hits of alternative conformations: Mad2_test_best_hits.txt
* Cluster analysis result as an image file: Mad2_test.png

*This takes <70 Minutes to run on an A100 GPU (generates 200 structures total + 200 foldseek files).* <br>
